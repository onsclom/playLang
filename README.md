# funLang

A language I am making for fun. Mainly I am just curious how hard it is to actually make a programming language.

## Goals

- Simple and intuitive syntax
- Documentation for language and its standard library fits on one page
- Can be used to draw non trivial animated graphics

## Interesting properties

- Only one "data type": tables
- Everything is a function
- One function per line
- No strings, only numbers
