current goals:
    - add more functions
        - line, circle, rect
        - more math stuff
        - rename table to list perhaps?
    - add a console with nice error handling
        - include error for when frame takes too long (perhaps use made an infinite loop or something crazy)
    - make some nice examples
        - particle.js like line things
        - snow
        - hyperspeed star field?
        - perhaps a 3d cube wireframe?

maybe future goals (in no particular order):
    o make in browser IDE with code mirror
        o syntax highlighting
        o console
        o nice error messages
        o perhaps a bit of line by line debugging like stuff?
    o read input
        o mouse
        o keyboard
        o game controller?
        o midi?
    o auto generated docs
        o parse the JSDOC for auto generated documentation?
    o make a way to learn the language through exercises!
        o exercises should be super easy
        o should be able to complete them all in one session
        o should throw some confetti at the end and say "wow you learned the whole language, nice" lol
