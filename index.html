    <h3><i> really elementary and minimal yet fun </i></h3>

    <h2>what is it?</h2>
    <p>
      a <b>programming language</b> and <b>coding environment</b> that is fun to
      use for graphical experiments, but is probably impractical to use for much
      else. currently a major work in progress and things are subject to heavily change.
    </p>

    <h2>how does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      every line details a single instruction. the first word of a line is the instruction
      name. the remaining words are arguments for that instruction. checkout the
      documentation for details on the existing instructions.
    </p>

    <h2>why?</h2>
    <p>
      in the beginning, part of me was curious if i could make my own language and
      environment for making non-trivial graphical experiments. another part of
      me thought it could be a fun way to introduce beginners to programming.
      now i am just goofing around adding and features i think are interesting.
      it has been really fun making this.
    </p>
